### Peer-reviewed publications

* **Ramírez, M.A.**, Smerlak M., Traulsen, A. & Jost, J. (2023). [Diversity enables the jump towards cooperation for the Traveler’s Dilemma. Scientific Reports. 13, 1441.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-28600-5)
---
  * Key finding: Players can achieve a cooperative, high-payoff equilibrium by escaping a local maximization and jumping to the global game where the payoff structure is different.
    * We study the Traveler's Dilemma, a social dilemma where individual incentives lead players to mutual undercutting.
    * We decompose the dilemma into a local and a global game.
    * Using evolutionary game theory and learning models, we find that diversity - meaning the presence of suboptimal strategies- enables players to move towards cooperation, improving both individual and collective payoffs.
  * Tools: Mathematical modelling - Evolutionary game theory 🧩 - Dynamical systems 📈

### Preprints
* **Ramírez, M.A.**, Kolumbus, Y., Nagel, R., Wolpert, D. & Jost, J. (2023). [Game manipulators - the strategic implications of binding contracts.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10586)
    * Key finding: Commitment devices, particularly binding contracts, can be used to manipulate players.
      * External agents, namely game manipulators, can leverage these devices to extract fees from players.
      * The research focuses on formulating the logic behind such manipulation.
      * We explore the behaviour of regret-minimising agents in the different manipulation scenarios.
    * Tools: Mathematical modelling - Reinforcement learning 🔁 - Agent-based modelling 👥

### Other publications

* **Ramírez, M.A.** (2020). [Cost calculation of an altruistic act for the plasmids-in-bacteria system through probabilistic simulations.](https://repositorio.uniandes.edu.co/entities/publication/d8c17b0d-7c58-402f-b3d3-7d1221b26531)
  * Key finding: Practical method for measuring the cost of altruism in biological systems.
    * The research explores multilevel selection as a mechanism for establishing cooperation in bacterial plasmids.
    * The study derives an expression for the cost of altruism, finding that it depends on the degree of selfishness at the individual level.
  * Tools: Mathematical modelling - Stochastic simulations 🎲 - Big data analysis 💻
